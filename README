Amazon Glacier is a long-term persistent file-storage system for cold data storage. 

As a GUI wrapper for the Glacier command line tools, the Simple Amazon Glacier Uploader aims to be an upload and download solution that is as durable as your data.

SAGU is a single .jar file Glacier interface written in Java for cross-platform usability. 

The use of Java assures that you will have access to your files regardless of your operating system when it is time to retrieve your data.
