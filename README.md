The unlimited storage plan with [Amazon's Cloud Drive](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/) has solved my need for cheap large-scale file storage. 

Amazon Glacier is a long-term persistent file-storage system for cold data storage. 

The Simple Amazon Glacier Uploader aims to be an upload and download solution that is as durable as your data.

SAGU is a single .jar file Glacier interface written in Java for cross-platform usability.
